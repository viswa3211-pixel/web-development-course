    <p>The call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>
    <p>do the calculation then disply the result</p>

        function add(x, y) {
            return x + y;
        }
        function average(x, y) {
            return add(x, y) / 2;
